# Example

## Original prompt

## Observations and improvements
 * Instructions were a little unclear on sorting and output, I used the format selected
 because it seemed like something that could be useable for people attempting to understand
 how many adults were in each household (possibly for marketing purposes)
 * Household addresses were normalized for better matching purposes
 * The first line of output for each Household is the normalized address for the household,
 This can be compared to each occupants individual address to make sure they were placed in
 the correct location at a glance
